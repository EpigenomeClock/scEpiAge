# AgingClock_v2

Here we present an epigentic clock in mouse. This packages accompanies the manuscript of Bonder et al currently in biorXiv. 
Using the code provided here you are able to predict the age of a mouse using DNA-methylation information in Liver, Lung or Blood.
To run the code check the : `./Runner.R` file. 

This package contains all the code needed to predict the methylation age for a new sample. 
For convenience we have included the data from the Gravina et al study (PMID: 27380908). 
To do an initial test of the model and to see if the setup is correct, please check the predictionX_org.txt files and compare them with the default output.
